<strong>Starting virtualMe</strong><hr>
	You can start VirtualMe simply by opening the index.html file in the VirtualMe folder or pressing the emulator button and then open VirtualMe officially option in the emulator page.
	<br><strong>Loading an OS</strong><hr>
	To load an OS, you simply point the path to that OS. e.g.C:\projects\MyOS The start.js file in C:\projects\myOS will be automatically loaded and the start function called. Alternatively you can type demoOS/LinuxMe Basic will automatically load LinuxMe Basic. <warning><strong>Note that this second style, </strong></warning>which you do not define the full path loads only OSs after the current folder in where the OS is. I mean the folder where the index.html file of VirtualMe is located. If in the folder where index.html is and and another folder is inside e.g. OSfold   and you want to start OSfold, simply type  OSfold. this os because they are sharing the same folder and therefore the path is the same.
